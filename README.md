# Mind-Mappings-of-30-Days-Plan-for-C-Plus-Plus-11

This is the mind mapping of my 30 days plan for C++11. I'm currently reading the book named <<Effective C++>> and <<More Effective C++>> and taking notes of them. I am also following the structure of  [CPPReference](https://zh.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm). 
Thanks for their awesome details about the C++ and I've learned much more than I could imagine.
I make this plan in order to let me familiar with the advanced C++ and  get into the habit of sharing any technological notes.
